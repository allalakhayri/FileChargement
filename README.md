# File Chargement App
File Chargement App is a simple Java application that allows you to load and display the contents of a text file in a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) library.

## Installation
To use this app, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official Java website.

Once you have Java installed, you can download the FileChargementApp.java file from the releases section of this GitHub repository.

## Usage
To use the app, follow these steps:

Double-click on the FileChargementApp.java file to launch the app.
Click on the "Choose File" button to select the text file that you want to load.
Click on the "Load File" button to load the contents of the file into the app.
The app will display the contents of the file in a text area, with each line of the file displayed on a separate line.
As each line is loaded, a green rectangle will be drawn on a canvas to indicate that the line has been loaded.
Once all lines have been loaded, a message will be displayed on the canvas indicating that the loading is complete.
Note: The app only supports loading of text files. If you try to load a non-text file, an error message will be displayed.

## Acknowledgments
This app was inspired by similar file loading apps found online, and uses the Java AWT library for the GUI components. Special thanks to the developers of the Java AWT library for providing the tools to create graphical user interfaces in Java.
